This was a part of a Semester Project in Logic.  
The focus here in these codes was on:
* PCNF in First-Order Logic (FOL)
* Substitution and Unification
* Herbrand Models
* Horn Clauses
* SLD-Resolution
* Occurs-Check  

The books followed were:
* Mathematical Logic in Computer Science (Ben-Ari)
* Logic Programming with Prolog (Max Bramer)
